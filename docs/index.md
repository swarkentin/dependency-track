title: Introduction

Dependency-Track is an intelligent [Supply Chain Component Analysis] platform that allows organizations to 
identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. Dependency-Track takes a unique
and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of [Software Bill-of-Materials] (SBOM). This approach 
provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.

Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to 
proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in 
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) environments.
