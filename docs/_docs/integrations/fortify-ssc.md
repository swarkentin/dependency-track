Dependency-Track can automatically publish results to Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) providing a 
consolidated view of security-centric code findings and vulnerable component findings. 

Dependency-Track accomplishes this in the following ways:

* Fortify SSC integration is configured in Dependency-Track
* Dependency-Track pushes findings to Fortify SSC on a periodic basis (configurable)
* A plugin for Fortify SSC parses Dependency-Track findings

Requirements:
* Dependency-Track v3.4.0 or higher
* Fortify SSC 17.20 or higher
* [Download](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/fortify-ssc-plugin/releases) and install Dependency-Track plugin for Fortify SSC

### Dependency-Track Configuration

#### Global configuration

#### Per-project configuration
Dependency-Track includes the ability to specify configuration properties on a per-project basis. 
This feature is used to map projects in Dependency-Track to applications in Fortify SSC. 

| Attribute      | Value                             |
| ---------------| --------------------------------- |
| Group Name     | `integrations`                    |
| Property Name  | `fortify.ssc.applicationId`       |
| Property Value | The application version ID in SSC |
| Property Type  | `STRING`                          |

At this point the plugin is installed and ready to accept payloads from Dependency-Track.
Once Dependency-Track pushes a payload to SSC, it will be displayed among the projects
artifacts and the results will be filterable within the audit view.
